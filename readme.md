# Introduction

This code is a demonstration of a new contact algorithm for finite element solvers. The project is ongoing but will be 
implemented in [Fierro](https://github.com/lanl/Fierro). See that repo for more details.

As for running this code, be sure to have `meshio` installed via `pip install meshio`. Then, run `test_contact.py` to 
ensure that the code is working properly. Run the many example scripts to see visuals of the results. The crux of the 
code is in `contact.py`.
